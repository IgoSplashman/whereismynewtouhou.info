      Where can I buy the game(s)?
    </h1>
    Unfortuntally you can only buy physical CDs of the games. Some good places to get the games include <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> and <a href="http://jbox.com" target="_blank">J-LIST/JBOX</a>. You may also want to checkout local stores and conventions. The #newtouhou is availible for pre-order on <a href="https://jbox.com/series/touhou-project/zsth0024" target="_blank">JBOX</a>.
